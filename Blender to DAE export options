Exporting Blend to DAE when using shape keys:

Update the better collada exporter so you get "Export Shape Keys" option,

Check On:
  Selected Objects
  Tangent Arrays
  Triangulate
  Active Layers
  Exclude Control bones
  Export Animation
  All Actions
  Optimize Keyframes
  Shape Keys
  

The following two options are in Object data tab.
Use shape keys "Relative" option
Set Normals to Auto smooth.

Hopefully that allows for a usable shape keys export without breaking the mesh or making the mesh disappear!
